# My Game Project

## Overview
This project is a simple game built using TypeScript. It features a player character that can move and jump within a 3D environment. The game is designed to be easily extendable, allowing developers to add new features and components as needed.

## Features
- Player movement and jumping mechanics
- Basic game loop with rendering context
- Modular architecture with separate components and systems
- Asset management for models, sounds, and textures
